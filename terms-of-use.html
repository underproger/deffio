                    <p>An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on eligible
                        devices. The private key is associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used

                        responsible for the retention and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase (“Secret
                        Phrase”) associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase, and
                        private key access information secure. It is very important that you back up your private keys,
                        backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Digital
                        Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store
                        your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase

                        remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address
                        and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital
                        Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible. Accordingly, we
                        shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your
                        wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet address,
                        Secret Phrase and private key information secure.</p>

                    <h3>DIGITAL ASSET TRANSACTIONS</h3>
                    <p>In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and
                        recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized,
                        peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or
                        operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not
                        ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and
                        processed. By using our service, you acknowledge and agree that: we do not have the ability to
                        cancel or otherwise modify your transaction; the transaction details you submit may not be
                        completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks; we do not
                        store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital
                        Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us, and therefore
                        we do not guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY USER</h3>
                    <p>You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and
                        complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions
                        that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services. We
                        strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to
                        transfer a Digital Asset.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
                    <p>You can receive push notifications from us which will alert you when transactions involving your
                        wallet are completed. You can access this service by going to “Settings” and turning “Push
                        notifications” on/off.</p>

                    <h3>TRANSACTION FEES</h3>
                    <p>There may be transaction fees (e.g. mining fees) associated with your virtual currency
                        transactions that are required by the virtual currency system or blockchain network that you
                        engage with. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or “gas” to
                        complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will
                        not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set transaction
                        fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your wallet
                        address. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not have access to your or anyone else’s
                        transactions.</p>

                        extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of the term shall not affect or impair the
                        validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision or any other
                        terms, clauses or provisions of these Terms.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control,

                        for the avoidance of doubt, changes to any blockchain-related protocol, other catastrophe, or
                        any other occurrences which are beyond our reasonable control, and shall not affect the validity
                        and enforceability of any remaining provisions. If we are unable to perform our Services
                        outlined in the Terms due to factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the
                        aforementioned force majeure events or changes in applicable laws and/or sanctions policies, we
